Minecraft 1.8-1.8.9 Hacked Client
(Work in progress)

## how to install
* click on the latest file (DO NOT CLONE THE WHOLE REPO), and click download
* move the zip into %appdata%/.minecraft/.versions/
* unpack the zip here using the standard windows zip tool
* add the version to your installations list in the launcher

NOTE: b1 and b2 version requires java 11 to run, if you run it with java 8 you'll only get errors, so install java 11 (and select the right executable in the installation properties) or wait for the next release, which will require java 8.
